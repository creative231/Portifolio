            <p>
             I’m a multidisciplinary professional with experience in frontend
        development, graphic design, and geospatial analysis. My background
        allows me to approach problems from both technical and visual
        perspectives.

              <div>
            <p>
              As a frontend developer, I build scalable interfaces using React and
        modern CSS frameworks. As a graphic designer, I create visual materials
        such as flyers, posters, and certificates. As a geospatial analyst, I
        work with GIS systems, spatial data, and mapping tools to extract
        meaningful insights.
